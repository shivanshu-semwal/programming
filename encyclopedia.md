## A

* **Assembly(ASM)** - programming language, low-level, architecture dependent, one-to-one mapping with machine code after preprocessing.
* **Assembler** - used to compile assembly programming language. Some famous assembler are `NASM`, `MASM`
* **ASCII** - American Standard Code For Information Interchange. It's table is divides into three sections: `Non-printable`(0-31), `Lower ASCII`(32-127)(used in old computers, use 7 bit only), `Higher ASCII`(128-255)(characters are based on the language you are using, or on the program you are running).

## N

## O



## P
